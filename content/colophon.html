<p>This site is supported by two useful frameworks: <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>, a great responsive CSS framework, and <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>, a static site generator written in ruby. These tools help me compile the site to fully static assets for speed and security. Those can be uploaded to any HTTP server, regardless of configuration.</p>

<p>Documentation on how this works can be found <a href="http://github.com/danndalf/portfolio">in the repository for this site on github</a>.</p> 

<h2>Usability</h2>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Typography</th>
		<td>The <a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a> humanist sans-serif typeface presents the header and body copy on this site owing to its open license, good legibility, strong kerning, and wide array of glyph support. Where a monospace typeface is required (e.g. in code examples), <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> is used for many of the same reasons.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Markup</th>
		<td>All public-facing markup used in this site is specification-conformant <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">HTML 5, CSS 3</a>, and RSS. Where appropriate, data is also serialized using <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Responsive<br />Design</th>
		<td>This site should look good in most browsers and on most devices, and has been tested on a wide variety of platforms, browsers, desktops, netbooks, tablets, and phones. In some areas such as the music page, graceful feature degradation isn't possible without introducing the insecurities of Flash. There, you will still be offered the content for download, but will be directed to upgrade your browser for the full experience.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Accessibility</th>
		<td>All pages of this site aim to conform to level AA of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>. This should permit people with disabilities to use it through screen readers and text-based browsers.</td>
