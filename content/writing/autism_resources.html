It's not a disease to be cured, rather it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity">a set of cognitive traits that have a lot in common with each other and bring unique perspectives and challenges to life</a>. This article describes some of my history with autism and offers some guidance on having a happy, productive life with Autism.</p>


    <h2>Personal history with Autism</h2>

    <p>As a child, I didn't speak until I could use complete sentences. I have the signature wide-set eyes, short mid-face, and wide forehead of people with ASD. My first sentence, at the age of four, was "May I have some juice, please?", which <em>floored</em> my mother.</p>

    <p>I didn't make eye contact with anyone and preferred quietly rocking back and forth by myself, sometimes banging rocks together, quietly whispering to a blade of grass, or staring blankly at an "empty" wall while listening to classical music tapes. It took the state numerous consecutively broader IQ tests before they could get a solid measurement and officially call me a savant. In third grade, they moved me to gifted classes from my other mentally handicapped peers.</p>

    <p>By age 12, I'd built my first few computers and networks, and had written and trained my first neural networks and protocol analyzers. By the end of elementary school, I had taught myself four languages and basic calculus, because Sanskrit was so much easier than smalltalk.</p>

    <p>In Junior High and High School, I managed to make a few friends, and kept up with all manner of technical, language, and musical interests. By age 17, I was the youngest person ever certified to repair every piece of hardware IBM had commercially released. It would be another decade before I went on my first date.</p>

    <p>In university, I finally taught myself to stop rocking back and forth and tapping my leg incessantly&mdash;"stimming", as it's called in ASD parlance. I stuck around academia for the next 14 years. That included 10 years of undergraduate study across fourteen different majors followed by four of grad school. I stuck with it because it was one of the few places I felt safe and understood.</p>

    <p>Over time, I learned about the other traits of mine that are closely related to autism: <a href="/writing/mutant_superpowers/index.html">synaesthesia</a>, ADHD, Ehlers-Danlos, <a href="/writing/mutant_superpowers/index.html">photographic memory</a>, and a variant of Multiple Sclerosis. Many common genetic disorders cluster with Autism.</p>

    <p>These days, I still don't go to loud places unless there's a rhythm involved. I still prefer music based in repetition, variation, and evolution. Texture and modulation matter way more than melody or vocals to me. "Dancing" for me looks an awful lot like rocking back and forth. And I am still perfectly happy sitting and staring at an an "empty" wall while listening to classical music. But these days it comes from FLAC files, and my sound system is much bigger.</p>


    <h2>Effects on daily life</h2>

    <p>Autism effects every aspect of my daily life:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I work in engineering and math in a half-dozen specialized fields.</li>
      <li>I still stare off into space frequently, since I also see what I hear.</li>
      <li>I seldom make eye contact without concentrated effort.</li>
      <li>Smalltalk eludes me. If you comment on the weather, I'll probably comment on the thermodynamics of cloud formation.</li>
      <li>I can't tune things out. If I can hear three people talking, I'm listening to all three, and it's probably overwhelming. People I know on the Autism spectrum seldom possess the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect">Cocktail Party Effect</a>.</li>
      <li>I don't have social instinct, but <a href="https://theestablishment.co/what-it-means-to-be-highly-empathetic-and-autistic-e3cc3a05ebe6">do have strong empathy</a> despite my flat social affect.</li>
      <li>Sarcasm baffles me, and it takes many months for me to learn how to communicate with those who rely on it.</li>
      <li>I keep detailed records of my life so I can make sense of it with numerical analysis.</li>
      <li>Overstimulation regularly contributes to anxiety.</li>
      <li>I have always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_walking">walked on my toes</a>, which now requires braces to be able to walk without pain.</li>
      <li>Social cues aren't intuitive to me; I have to memorize and act them liturgically, as rituals.</li>
      <li>I don't take phone calls unless there are no other options, and I never use voice interfaces on my devices.</li>
      <li>I couldn't read an analog clock until age 32.</li>
      <li>I still can't tell my left from my right without focused, concentrated effort.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Useful strategies for dealing with the hard parts</h2>

    <p><strong>Braces</strong>: <a href="http://notiptoe.com/index.html">Foot braces</a> relieve a considerable amount of the pain from toe-walking, and help me more evenly distribute my weight across my feet. And for those of us with Ehlers-Danlos as well, hand braces can similarly cut down on joint pain.</p>

    <p><strong>Clothing</strong>: Softness and consistency matter more than most other factors when deciding what to buy and wear. Anything you can do to cut down on constant stimulation, the easier things will be.</p>

    <p><strong>Downtime</strong>: Time to myself goes on my calendar first every week&mdash;around 20 total hours of no mandatory social interactions, with basically no exceptions. Generally, this happens all day on Sundays and all evening on Wednesdays. Socializing is very rewarding for me and also very taxing.</p>

    <p><strong>Navigation</strong>: Without being able to intuitively tell my right from my left, I navigate by landmarks, cardinal directions, and uphill / downhill directions. It's much easier for me to figure out north, south, east, and west based on the sun, stars, and landmarks.</p>

    <p><strong>Meditation</strong>: To have a reasonably functional life, I have to meditate twice a day. I can't skip it, or I will be irritable and off center all day. Meditation lasts for thirty minutes once I'm awake, and thirty minutes in the early evening. I keep a notebook to record things that I need to process, then let them go as they come to me.</p>

    <p><strong>Mindfulness</strong>: In general, multi-tasking is a complete non-starter. In order to do anything right, I generally must do one thing at a time: chop wood, <em>then</em> carry watter. Some life skills such as cooking and driving a car require multi-tasking, however. The key to being able to make sense of more than one thing at once is to tie it into a rhythm or a series of loops: a pattern I can process repeatedly until a task is complete.</p>

    <p><strong>Routine</strong>: Routine is critical. Whenever I encounter novelty in my environment, such as a new job or living arrangement, developing a daily routine is my top priority. Knowing the order in which things are done matters more than having a time that those things must start or end. Towards that end, major life changes have to happen gradually, in stages, in order not to be overwhelming. For example, when moving house, I pack a few boxes per day for weeks rather than everything over a couple of days.</p>

    <p><strong>Social cues</strong>: In order to be able to process social cues and facial expressions, I had to study them as if they were a language, with the help of neurotypical friends. Enunciation, posture, stance, gait, facial micro-expressions, vocal stress and intonation all carry signals. Facial expression flash cards can help.</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Budget</strong>: I budget sensory stimulus, since I have no choice but to process everything that crosses my perception. Things that are predictable or follow patterns are what ground me. Originally, that was rocking back and forth, tapping things on my leg, hitting my head on things, making clicking noises, or repetitive head movements. Now, I carry earplugs and occasionally also sunglasses everywhere and use them when I need less stimulation. My home environment is nearly always tidy, quiet, and with only just enough light to accomplish daily tasks.</p>

    <p><strong>Universal Capture</strong>: I'm constantly taking in more information than I can process. To help out with this, I carry <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/collections/model/product/squared-notebook-pocket">a little black notebook</a> and <a href="http://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/">pen</a> everywhere I go. When I encounter something I want to process but can't process then and there, it goes into the notebook to process later. I use the <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done productivity methodology</a> paired with <a href="http://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> from there on out. For people with dysgraphia, a voice recorder can serve the same purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Weighted Blankets</strong>: Much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug_machine">a hug machine</a>, weighted blankets or a pile of normal blankets can provide calming deep pressure stimulation. Where hugs can be overwhelming to some due to their unpredictable sensory nature, weighted blankets can both calm me down and help me get to sleep if I'm wound up at one point or another.</p>
